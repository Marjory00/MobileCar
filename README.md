    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MobileCar.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MobileCar.git)
    cd MobileCar
    ```
2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

3.  **Check Configuration:** Ensure the **`.env`** file in the `server/` directory is present and configured for the API port (default is 3000).

### 2. Run the Application

1.  **Start the Backend API:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # API is running on http://localhost:3000
    ```
    Keep this terminal window open.

## üí° How to Use the Demo

The application uses floating buttons at the bottom-right of the screen to switch between user roles.

| Button | Role | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer View** | **Vehicle Owner** | Submit new service requests and track a driver's progress in real-time. |
| **Driver View** | **Mobile Technician** | Toggle **Online/Offline** status, accept pending jobs, and view current earnings. |

To see a full cycle, start as a **Customer**, submit a request, then switch to the **Driver View**, go **Online**, and accept the new job from the queue.
